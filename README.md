# Meet me
Hello there. My name is Michael Obasoro, and this is my GitHub portfolio. 
Well, sort of.

I am someone who enjoys finding programming solutions to the windiest of problems, some of which I plan to showcase here frequently.
My stack? I'm afraid it's not that simple. I simply go around learning whatsoever piques my interest even when it doesn't necessarily have to do with tech. Dare I say I enjoy running into problems that need solving. But let's save the rambling for some other day. Here are the programming languages or technologies I frequent:

## My Stack
* Python
* Django
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Bootstrap
* C++ 
* Unity

> What's more?

My dream goal is to eventually become a fully-fledged game designer. And I know someday, I most definitely will.  
But on my journey to this very pot of gold, I took a detour to the realm of backend development- another pot of gold. This is where I'm at currently. My day-to-day progress and some of the projects I've built would be showcased here.

> Just a little bit more.

I may have forgotten to mention this, but I'm currently a third-year Computer Science undergraduate. So I can quite confidently say that I'm fully kitted with fundamentals such as Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## When I'm not programming
Besides frequently being hunched over my workspace mashing away at my keyboard, I'm also a writer. I enjoy writing all sorts of stuff, but my preference- is creative writing. There's also me being a retired-ish competitive gamer. Other hobbies include, well, gaming, sports (football & basketball to be precise), singing, watching anime, reading all sorts of books and much much more.
